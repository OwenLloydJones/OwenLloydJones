I am Currently a University Student on a placement year at Computacenter, working within the Cyber Security function known as Group Information Assurance. Although my job is not hugely coding oriented, i try where ever i can to adapt the tools used within the team to overcome the challenges our function faces within the world of security.

I will soon be returning to Coventry University to complete my final year of study and take on the challenge of my dissertation.

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working on: A Python Script that utilises the Shodan API to create a powerful tool for business.
- 🐍 I’m currently learning : Python 
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm happy to connect on LinkedIn and collaborate.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Every couple of years i get tasked with a new challenge in coding, I learn a new language to adapt to the situation and then propmtly forget the syntax a year later, hence the wide range of languages seen on my page.
